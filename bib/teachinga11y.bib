  abstract     = {Work integrating conversations around AI and Disability is vital and valued, particularly when done through a lens of fairness. Yet at the same time, analysing the ethical implications of AI for disabled people solely through the lens of a singular idea of "fairness" risks reinforcing existing power dynamics, either through reinforcing the position of existing medical gatekeepers, or promoting tools and techniques that benefit otherwise-privileged disabled people while harming those who are rendered outliers in multiple ways. In this paper we present two case studies from within computer vision - a subdiscipline of AI focused on training algorithms that can "see" - of technologies putatively intended to help disabled people but, through failures to consider structural injustices in their design, are likely to result in harms not addressed by a "fairness" framing of ethics. Drawing on disability studies and critical data science, we call on researchers into AI ethics and disability to move beyond simplistic notions of fairness, and towards notions of justice.},

  abstract    = {Digital technologies allow people with disabilities to participate independently in society in ways they never could before. The full realization of these new opportunities remains elusive, though, because working professionals in the information and communication technology (ICT) field rarely receive adequate training in how to make digital ICT accessible to people with disabilities. Adding accessibility to the university ICT curriculum can help create a critical mass of ICT professionals with accessibility awareness and expertise to finally realize the full accessibility potential of digital technologies. This dissertation provides a rich informational context from which ICT curriculum leaders can decide how to best infuse accessibility into their own curriculum. Part I consists of detailed case study narratives of curricula at three universities, documenting the context in which the curriculum was developed, the curriculum rationale, and the process of design and implementation. The three case studies were: (a) the Web Sciences master's degree program at the University of Linz in Austria, (b) the Instructional Technology master's degree program at George Mason University in the United States, and (c) the Digital Inclusion master's degree program at Middlesex University in the United Kingdom. Part II consists of a thematic analysis across the case studies of six main themes: (a) the curriculum goals and rationale; (b) the curriculum design process, from idea to implementation; (c) defining the scope of the curriculum; (d) instructional materials and strategies; (e) instructional format and media choices; and (f) program sustainability. The last theme, program sustainability, proved to be one of the most crucial aspects of incorporating accessibility into the ICT curriculum. Part III situates the ICT curriculum within the broader theoretical economic development framework of the capability approach, which is an approach to economic development that takes into account many variables in the quality of human life, not just financial measures. The discussion addresses the unique power of digital ICT to create capabilities in people with disabilities, and the role of the ICT curriculum within an "accessibility ecosystem" of diverse, interconnected stakeholders. The discussion concludes with a list of indicators for measuring accessibility content in the ICT curriculum.},

  abstract     = {AI technologies have the potential to dramatically impact the lives of people with disabilities (PWD). Indeed, improving the lives of PWD is a motivator for many state-of-the-art AI systems, such as automated speech recognition tools that can caption videos for people who are deaf and hard of hearing, or language prediction algorithms that can augment communication for people with speech or cognitive disabilities. However, widely deployed AI systems may not work properly for PWD, or worse, may actively discriminate against them. These considerations regarding fairness in AI for PWD have thus far received little attention. In this position paper, we identify potential areas of concern regarding how several AI technology categories may impact particular disability constituencies if care is not taken in their design, development, and testing. We intend for this risk assessment of how various classes of AI might interact with various classes of disability to provide a roadmap for future research that is needed to gather data, test these hypotheses, and build more inclusive algorithms.},

While the key course concepts vary from the entire lifecycle to specific aspects of design, concepts like accessibility are rare. This paper will present a study of team projects in a requirements engineering course. One group of students conducted projects with accessibility requirements while another group of students delivered projects without accessibility requirements. The course content was the same, including discussion of accessibility. To support the understanding of accessibility, stakeholders with disabilities were included in the requirements engineering process. Both teams benefited from the experience as indirect knowledge acquisition occurred. Students from a previous offering of the course, with no external stakeholder interaction, demonstrated lower levels of accessibility understanding.},

As a result, computing education needs to respond by providing students opportunities to learn about accessibility and designing for inclusion. This article presents results of a qualitative research study of practices in teaching accessibility in university-level programs in the US. The study included interviews with 18 professors from some of the top universities in the US and a content analysis of syllabi and other teaching materials. Using the pedagogical theory of authentic learning and elements from the 21st Century Skills framework, we found that instructors emphasized the need for students to develop awareness and understanding for a diversity of ICT users through multiple different experiences; experiences that included research projects that directly involve users with disabilities, guest speakers, field trips, simulating disabilities, and the use of videos/movies. Additionally, instructors used multiple resources (e.g., research papers, online resources), in part, to offset the challenge that there is a perceived lack of a comprehensive textbook. Instructors also emphasized the importance of their individual initiative; that is, the inclusion of accessible topics or courses was often linked to a faculty member's research and/or personal commitment. This article contributes to a gap in the literature by disseminating and sharing different approaches to teaching accessibility across multiple instructors, courses, and campuses.},

Students focused on a design project while learning UCD concepts and techniques, working with people with and without disabilities throughout the project. We found that designing for both disabled and non-disabled users surfaced challenges and tensions in finding solutions to satisfy both groups, influencing students' attitudes toward accessible design. In addressing these tensions, non-functional aspects of accessible design emerged as important complements to functional aspects for users with and without disabilities.},

We incorporated accessibility in a design thinking course and observed student learning. We sought to challenge accessibility as niche, learn methods and barriers for including accessibility in the curricula, and identify impact on student learning. We found that students grasped general design concepts while designing for disabled and nondisabled users, and they faced challenges designing for both populations in concert.

We received a representative sample of at least one response from 318 of the 352 institutions we surveyed, totaling 1,857 responses. We found that 175 institutions (50\%) had at least one instructor teaching accessibility and that no fewer than 2.5\% of faculty overall teach accessibility. Faculty that teach accessibility are twice as likely to be female, to have expertise in HCI and software engineering, and to know people with disabilities. The most critical barriers to teaching accessibility that faculty reported were the absence of clear and discipline-specific accessibility learning objectives and the lack of faculty knowledge about accessibility. Faculty desired resources that were specific to the areas of computing in which they teach rather than general accessibility resources and guidelines.},

  abstract      = {Ethics in the emerging world of data science are often discussed through cautionary tales about the dire consequences of missteps taken by high profile companies or organizations. We take a different approach by foregrounding the ways that ethics are implicated in the day-to-day work of data science, focusing on instances in which data scientists recognize, grapple with, and conscientiously respond to ethical challenges. This paper presents a case study of ethical dilemmas that arose in a "data science for social good" (DSSG) project focused on improving navigation for people with limited mobility. We describe how this particular DSSG team responded to those dilemmas, and how those responses gave rise to still more dilemmas. While the details of the case discussed here are unique, the ethical dilemmas they illuminate can commonly be found across many DSSG projects. These include: the risk of exacerbating disparities; the thorniness of algorithmic accountability; the evolving opportunities for mischief presented by new technologies; the subjective and value- laden interpretations at the heart of any data-intensive project; the potential for data to amplify or mute particular voices; the possibility of privacy violations; and the folly of technological solutionism. Based on our tracing of the team's responses to these dilemmas, we distill lessons for an ethical data science practice that can be more generally applied across DSSG projects. Specifically, this case experience highlights the importance of: 1) Setting the scene early on for ethical thinking 2) Recognizing ethical decision-making as an emergent phenomenon intertwined with the quotidian work of data science for social good 3) Approaching ethical thinking as a thoughtful and intentional balancing of priorities rather than a binary differentiation between right and wrong.},

We also describe how our expertise in accessible design has extended beyond the education of computer science and engineering students to include Web content authors across campus.},

  abstract   = {Most CS students learn little about accessibility in higher education; this is partly because most CS faculty know little about accessibility. Unfortunately, higher education CS faculty lack a model of professional development for learning to teach new topics. Therefore, we investigated the feasibility of a "micro" professional development model for teaching accessibility in CS courses that could be used at scale. We conducted 18 semi-structured interviews with U.S. CS faculty, asking them to explore a prototype of a web-based professional development tool that linked accessibility topics to CS topics. We found that many organizational factors limited faculty's autonomy to integrate accessibility in many of their courses. We also found that individual values and knowledge constrained faculty's ability and willingness to both learn and integrate accessibility topics into their courses. However, many faculty expressed desire to teach accessibility in their courses if they had access to even basic accessibility content and materials to use in their courses.},
